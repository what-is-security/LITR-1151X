<strong>Faith</strong>
You’ve been feeling so far from Allah lately. Do you not think of Him? He is All-Knowing, and He Knows of you, but you don’t think of Him. Why is it that you put off that which gives you peace? You feel good when you pray. It makes you giddy when you have the chance to pray Tahajjud. So why do you avoid something you like? Are you afraid of something? Or is there something you like more that is bad for you?

<strong>On Debt</strong>
I keep thinking of that fever hallucination I used to have when I was younger. If I got sick enough, I’d hallucinate that my family was in debt because of me, so I had to repay the debt. Except, the terms of this debt were that I had to swallow a designated quantity of bland applesauce proportional to the debt I had put my family in. Like it was just texture, no taste, of the sauce as it went across my tongue. And then the realization would dawn on me that with interest, at the rate I was eating the debt, I’d have to keep swallowing it for all eternity. And suddenly time would become very abstract, and the momentary would condense into eternity—
I wonder if it was a premonition?

I’m reminded of the myth of Sisyphus too I guess.

<strong>On Tying My Camel</strong>
Kanza said something yesterday that felt so beautiful. It was from Allah, I know it. She was talking about how much work she puts in for exams and assignments actually don’t matter. As long as she tries, whatever she ends up with is what Allah decided for her, and she trusts in that.

This is from Allah; I must know it. I pray that know it.

<strong>“Romance”</strong>
Today was Hoe-lloween (alternatively, Hottie-ween). Asmaa, Nima, and Isatou invited the MSA girls to their place for what is now an annual hijabi hoedown (emphasis on the hoe, ignore the country connotations). We basically all took our scarves and jackets off to dance in significantly less-than-modest clothes. Amara went as JLo (she’s been obsessed since we saw Hustlers—side note: I still don’t like watching R-rated movies) in a black sparkly gown, and I had the bright idea to go as Amara. It wasn’t really a bright idea—I was “inspired” by Sawsan. I wore that really snug body con dress I got for $10 (which… I feel guilty about) with a denim jacket and a Pashmina scarf I borrowed from Zenab, just thrown on without any pins. Jammed my feet into some oversized dad shoes and put on my reddest lip gloss, and voila, I was Mama Majeed. I wanted to make a sign that said “Islam is the truth” (which, honestly, would have been so great, because it was the night of last year’s hoedown that Amara yelled it at a car driving by, the genesis of the joke), but I didn’t have the time. It was really fun, even after I broke out in hives (I pushed myself too far trying to pass off whatever I was doing as dancing, and their apartment was warm) and was just in the bathroom with some ice wrapped in the plastic that napkins come in. I found out Nadine can dance (but, looking back, how did I not expect that? She literally excels at everything) and Fatou is actually whining queen. Towards the end, Amara took off her dress and was just dancing in her underwear, and that was iconic.
I think the best part was actually that we were all sober, but we screamed and we shook and we were shook, and I smiled so much. Amal tried to teach me how to twerk (I have learned nothing) too, but I cannot move my body the way she does. I got to play one of my favorite songs, and Isatou liked it so much, she added it to her playlist??

What is it that makes us feel attractive?
The attention of men and the attention of women?
The possibility of the attention of men?
The very nature of the quality demands that there be another party on whom we rely to be deemed attractive.
But I also have to wonder about the required authenticity of that attention. The entire time at the party I was vaguely aware of the thought that people complimenting my dancing weren’t being genuine—regardless of whether they were, it doesn’t matter as long as it didn’t feel truly sincere to me. At the same time, it didn’t really bother me that the compliment may not have come from a genuine place; los piropos still felt nice to hear, and in a way, I still felt obligated to be grateful. Not just obligated, I was grateful, and that was interesting.
(Amara told me later that night that there was one thing that made her sad—she’d gone to a haunted house in Salem with Maliha, and one of the people dressed up to scare them said that Maliha was beautiful, and Amara said the fact that that just made Maliha’s night made her feel sad)

But, back to “romance”. Amara, Zenab (ohmygosh I forgot to mention Zenab—she took Halloween pajamas Heba left behind and wrapped them around her torso instead of just wearing them. She also did her hair up really cute, but she when she came in and took off the shawl covering her, everyone screamed so loud, I’m sure the MSA guys next door thought someone was dying. I guess triple DD boobs do that… though Zai (Zenab’s boyfriend) just rolled his eyes when he saw the fit)
But yes, around 1ish, Amara, Zenab, and I headed back to Zenab’s place. Zenab was suddenly really tired (I mean, she was dancing on Nima’s couch for a good hour—as if she wasn’t tall enough), so she napped on her couch while Amara and I talked. I was also compulsively scratching everywhere (the hives hadn’t subsided yet), but we had a really interesting conversation. Amara always makes comments like “wow, the guy who marries ______ is going to be so lucky”, especially after hoedowns, like “those dancing skillz” and “that bod-ay” won’t just be enjoyed in the company of women when that happens. We somehow got to talking about Amara’s preferences in men, and then I realized I hadn’t told Amara and Zenab yet about my “plans”.

I don’t think I’ll get married. Which is okay. And, obviously, I wouldn’t be with anyone outside an Islamic marriage, so… yeah. And that’s okay. It’s one thing to want to get married and feel like you won’t, and it’s another thing to not want to get married anyway. I don’t think I super enthusiastic about getting married. (TBC)

<strong>Tenere</strong>		<strong>Pro</strong>	<strong>Cras</strong>
What am I searching for? What do I want?
My own pleasure? The approval of others?
I know the pursuit of these things is flawed, that they won’t bring me contentment
I know what I should want
But I’m not striving towards it
