I had a paper due 12 hours ago (it's done for the most part), but I haven't been able to finish it since I've had back-to-back classes, and I had to run out of my meeting with my group for Design+Health because BERT is so gosh-darn <i>warm</i>. I felt so embarrassed—I've never really broken out in hives like that in front of anyone but family. Health Services also hadn't quite closed, but the nurse over the phone didn't think it was serious enough for me to come in so close to closing. I ended up just heading back to my room and <del>frantically</del> <del>futilely</del> scrubbing ice on my skin. It feels a little like a scene out of Tom & Jerry <a href="https://youtu.be/_LueFhQk5hg?t=40">or something</a>, where the character tries to plug a hole in a sinking boat and simultaneously the vessel springs multiple other leaks. I ice one place while ten other places are on fire, aching, <b>and</b>/or itching. It also feels like I'm being pricked everywhere with small, burning hot needles, like my skin is somehow getting the full-force beating deemed necessary by some forgotten and repressed Puritan society. My fingers lock up too from scratching so intensely, as if waterlogged from plugging all those leaks in my boat—maybe that's what rigor mortis is like. Not to mention the bruises I know I'll have. I've been thinking a lot about <u>contradiction</u>, and yet another small contradiction: I have to keep my fingernails trim so that I don't tear at my skin when I scratch in my sleep/scratch absentmindedly in the day, but when my nails aren't long and sharp, the itch isn't satisfied as easily, so I inadvertently apply more force with my blunted fingers. I've woken up with bruises on my legs and I'm just <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rClNZLXSKA8/maxresdefault.jpg">???</a>


I mean, it's also funny because it's not exactly the context in which a twenty year old woman ends up with bruises on her inner thighs, but also how else would <i>I</i> end up with marks like that?
